# Dataset
Particle_Data.csv contains the data used to train and test the machine learning models we used to classifiy different particles.
Particle Identities (PID):
0 - Leptons (electors and muons)
1 - Pions
2 - Kaons
3 - Protons

# Details about the files

All the files have the name that corresponds to the Machine Learning model or method we used to train and evaluate the models on the dataset.
For Example, NN.py for Neural Network, SVM.py for Support Vector Machines, 
                RF.py for Random Forest and kfold.py for K-Fold cross validation using Feedforward Neural Network.
                
# Python Packages
Machine Learning Libraries : Keras and Scikit-Learn
And in addition to these, we used Pandas, Numpy, Matplotlib and Seaborn.
